A simple floating contact button for WordPress fast, accessible, and clutter-free.

== Description ==

Most contact form plugins try to solve every use case and end up slowing sites down.

**Zontact takes a different approach.**

It focuses on one thing: helping visitors contact you quickly and easily.

Zontact adds a clean, lightweight floating contact button to your WordPress site. When clicked, it opens an **accessible modal contact form**, allowing users to get in touch without page reloads, visual clutter, or unnecessary features.

Built with performance, usability, and accessibility in mind, Zontact is ideal if you want a reliable contact solution without installing a heavy form builder.

### What Zontact Does

* Adds a floating contact button to your site (optional)
* Opens a fast, accessible modal contact form
* Sends messages directly to your email
* Optionally stores messages in WordPress for later reference

No page builders. No third-party services. Just clear communication.
