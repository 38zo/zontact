A simple floating contact button for WordPress: fast, accessible, and clutter-free.

== Description ==

Most contact form plugins try to do everything and end up slowing your site down.

**Zontact does one thing well.**

It adds a clean, lightweight floating contact button to your WordPress site. When clicked, it opens an **accessible modal contact form** so visitors can reach you quickly without page reloads, visual clutter, or bloated features you don’t need.

Zontact is built for performance, usability, and accessibility. If you want a simple way for users to contact you without installing a heavy form builder, Zontact is for you.
